# Stupid simple package builder

To build a package, just run

    ./build.sh PACKAGE_NAME

Assuming you've cloned the package repository under `packages` and put the required build dependencies in the Docker image

# Why?

Why would I use Docker to build packages when I can do it on my computer? The reason is simple, I don't use Ubuntu.
